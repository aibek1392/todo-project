## üöÄ Setup and Configuration

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
# Core meal planner dependencies
pip install langchain langchain-openai openai tiktoken pydantic

# Redis caching dependencies
pip install redis aioredis

# Environment management
pip install python-dotenv
```

Or use the provided requirements.txt:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Redis Setup

Install and start Redis:

**macOS:**
```bash
brew install redis
brew services start redis
```

**Ubuntu/Debian:**
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install redis-server
sudo systemctl start redis-server
sudo systemctl enable redis-server
```

**Windows:**
Download from https://redis.io/download or use Docker:
```bash
docker run -d -p 6379:6379 redis:alpine
```

**Test Redis connection:**
```bash
python test_redis_connection.py
```

### 3. Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory:

```bash
# Create .env file
cd backend
touch .env

# Add your OpenAI API key and Redis URL to .env
echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=your-actual-openai-api-key-here" >> .env
echo "REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379" >> .env
```

Your `.env` file should contain:
```bash
# backend/.env
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-actual-openai-api-key-here
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379  # Optional: defaults to localhost:6379
```

**Important**: 
- Replace `your-actual-openai-api-key-here` with your real OpenAI API key
- The `.env` file is gitignored to keep your API key secure
- Get your API key from: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
- Redis URL is optional and defaults to `redis://localhost:6379`

Alternatively, you can export the environment variables:
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key-here"
export REDIS_URL="redis://localhost:6379"
```

### 3. Database Schema

The meal planner integrates with your existing user profiles table. Expected profile structure:

```json
{
  "name": "User Name",
  "height_ft": 5.8,
  "weight_lbs": 150,
  "activity_level": "Moderate",
  "health_goals": ["Lose weight"],
  "preferences": {
    "diet": ["Vegetarian"],
    "allergies": ["Nuts"],
    "conditions": {
      "conditions": ["Diabetes"],
      "diabetesInsulin": true
    },
    "meals_per_day": 3,
    "snacks": true,
    "cooks_often": true,
    "dislikes": ["Mushrooms"]
  },
  "location": "New York, NY"
}
```

## üí° Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
```python
from meal_planner import generate_meal_plan

user_profile = {
    "basicInformation": {
        "username": "john_doe",
        "height": 5.9,
        "weight": 175,
        "activityLevel": "Moderate"
    },
    "healthGoal": {"goal": "Lose weight"},
    "dietaryPreferences": {"preferences": ["Mediterranean"]},
    "allergiesIntolerances": {"allergies": []},
    "mealHabits": {
        "mealsPerDay": 3,
        "snacks": false,
        "cooksOften": true
    }
}

meal_plan = await generate_meal_plan(user_profile)
print(f"Generated {len(meal_plan.meal_plan)} days")
print(f"Shopping list: {len(meal_plan.shopping_list)} items")
```

### With Redis Caching
```python
# First call - hits OpenAI API, stores in Redis
meal_plan1 = await generate_meal_plan(user_profile)

# Second call - uses Redis cache (much faster)
meal_plan2 = await generate_meal_plan(user_profile)

# Force fresh generation - bypasses cache
meal_plan3 = await generate_meal_plan(user_profile, force_refresh=True)
```

### Redis Cache Management
```python
from meal_planner import get_cache_stats, clear_meal_plan_cache

# Get Redis cache statistics
stats = await get_cache_stats()
print(f"Cache entries: {stats['total_entries']}")
print(f"Redis connected: {stats['redis_connected']}")
print(f"Cache size: {stats['total_size_mb']} MB")

# Clear specific user's cache
result = await clear_meal_plan_cache(user_profile)
print(f"Cleared {result['keys_deleted']} entries")

# Clear all cache entries
result = await clear_meal_plan_cache()
print(f"Cleared {result['keys_deleted']} total entries")
```

## üîß Configuration Options

### Model Configuration
```python
llm = ChatOpenAI(
    model="gpt-4-turbo-preview",  # Best quality for meal planning
    temperature=0.7,              # Balance creativity and consistency
    max_tokens=4000              # Enough for detailed meal plans
)
```

### Cache Configuration
- **TTL**: 24 hours (configurable in `generate_meal_plan`)
- **Storage**: In-memory (can be extended to Redis/database)
- **Key Generation**: MD5 hash of normalized profile data

### Prompt Engineering
The system uses a sophisticated prompt template that:
- Establishes nutritionist expertise and credentials
- Provides detailed user context and requirements
- Includes specific medical condition guidelines
- Ensures structured output format compliance

## üõ°Ô∏è Error Handling

### Common Errors
1. **Missing OpenAI API Key**: Set `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable
2. **Invalid Profile Data**: Ensure all required fields are present
3. **API Rate Limits**: Caching reduces API calls; implement retry logic
4. **Parsing Errors**: Pydantic models validate and handle malformed responses

### Debugging
- Set `verbose=True` in LLMChain for detailed logging
- Use test script to verify individual components
- Check cache statistics for performance monitoring

## üìà Performance Optimization

### Caching Benefits
- **Speed**: 10-100x faster for repeated requests
- **Cost**: Reduces OpenAI API usage and costs
- **Reliability**: Offline capability for cached profiles

### Scaling Considerations
- Move cache to Redis for multi-instance deployments
- Implement background refresh for popular profiles
- Add request queuing for high-volume usage
- Consider fine-tuned models for specific domains

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- **Recipe Details**: Step-by-step cooking instructions
